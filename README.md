#### A twitter bot to remove/block all those non-mutual followers who doesn't share the same spark.

This script removes all the uncommon followers from your twitter account by blocking them one by one and
then again unblocking them, like we usually do. To make things more clearer, it only removes those accounts
which you aren't following, but those accounts who you haven't shared that magic spark till this moment. This
script is super useful when you don't want to get followed by useless bots, non-active users & don't know maybe
some other personal issues. This script is tested, trusted and checked 137 times, so every part works just fine.

##### !!! Disclaimer: But though, RUN at your own risk (Just kidding, I know you want this badly.)

### Steps:

- Pip install the packages from the requirements.
- Locate keys.py and fill the details like author, consumer_key, consumer_secret, access tokens, token secrets
- Visit https://apps.twitter.com to get your credentials i.e. consumer keys and stuffs.

###### In short to run this, you need a developer account & need to initialize an application. Then you're good to go.
